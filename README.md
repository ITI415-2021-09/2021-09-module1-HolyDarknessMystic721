 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 
 Apple Picker is a game in which you control a set of three baskets and you must collect the Apples that are being dropped by the Tree. Each Apple is worth 100 points, so try to aim for a high score! Be careful not to lose your three baskets though. 

Mission Demolition is a game in which you launch a Ball from your Slingslot to attack and knock down a structure to the right. The main objective is to get to the green Goal located within the structure.

Prototype 1 is a game that is similar to Roll-a-Ball. The Player is a ball and you would need to collect yellow Pick-Ups that are located within little small box structures, similar to Mission Demolition. Each yellow Pick-Up is worth 100 points. Then, after you collect the Pick-Ups, proceed up a ramp to the second stage in which you must dodge red Enemies that will take away from your score in order to reach the goal located at the end. Each Enemy will take away 50 points from your score, so be careful of what you hit!
